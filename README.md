# The Collector
![demo](/Demo/the_collector_demo.gif)
This is a platformer game inspired by [King of Thieves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptolab.thieves.google) I did during a one week personal game jam.
The purpose of the project was to going back to programming gameplay and finish the main loop of the game.

You can play up to 5 different levels and save your score to beat your friends!

Enjoy and have fun!
